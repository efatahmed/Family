            <p>These two pictures are probably around 2021, in arif's house. Many people were these that day, althrough not all of them are in the picture. Let's talk about those who are there. <br> The one you see in the first picture is our passionate song lover Rakib. White hijab wali is one of my favorite people. Here she sits like a mulberry but she is a young girl. Mind is good but a bit dry. The handsome boy un the blue shirt sitting and looking intently at what I know is my dear good mama. He was a very wonderful person. I am saying becasue this incredible is no longer with us. May Allah grant him paradise, Ameen. The girl who is chatting us URMI, a funny person and of course beautiful.</p>
